# Engineering Team Summary

## Description

This repository was created so I could create a comand-line application that utilizes user input to creare a html file that displays the input to create the team summary. You can watch a video demonstrating the application's functionallity by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xgaduMbnL4YCh8XD54RdwyRM1l3sMEQT/view?usp=sharing).

You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I used JavaScript and the following Node.js packages: the built in "fs" and "path" packages, and an installed via npm package called "inquirer" to write my applicatian's code. I also used an installed via npm package called "jest" to test my code.



### Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). And after you've cloned or downloaded the repository use the command "npm install" in the terminal to install the necessary "inquirer" package as well as the "jest" package (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file).



### Usage

To use my command-line application you'll nead to clone or download the repository. If you have everything installed, you simply have to have your terminal in the same direcetory as app.js and use the command "node app.js" to run it. Once it runs you will be prompted for information that is to be included in the html file. After answering all prompts, in the output directory you will find a file named "team.html" and in this file is the generated html for your team summary needs.



### Credits

I used Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/), the "inquirer" package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and the "jest" package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest).

The html templates, renderhtml.js, and tests were provided by Trilogy Education Services (https://www.trilogyed.com/).

The styling was thanks to the power of Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).
